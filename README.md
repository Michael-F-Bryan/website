# The michaelfbryan.com Website

A small website for managing my personal affairs.

## Requirements

- Act as my front page to the internet
- Show a resume and GitHub portfolio
- Help the current user track their activities
- Let a user give out links to share specific information about specific
  activities with an anonymous user
- Store a list of all the crappy project ideas the user comes up with

## Follow-up Questions

- Does the application require authentication? i.e. do users need to log in?
- If authentication is needed, are there different user levels?
- Do we need an explicit administration panel?
- What constitutes an activity, and how detailed do they need to be?
- Are activities grouped in any way? (e.g. tagged or assigned to a particular
  project/employer)
- Can users upload their own files/content as part of an activity?
- What type of frontend should the system have?
- What kinds of devices will be accessing the frontend?
- Where will the data be stored?
- Is there any requirement for backing up and restoring the website?
- What type of reporting is needed?
- Do shared links expire?
- What sort of information will be shown in the shared links, and is it
  user-configurable?
- Are the resume and GitHub portfolio dynamically generated or hard-coded?
